                paragraph: `In computer programming, these processes/procedures are specified into
                detailed lists of instructions – what is called the source code representation of software
                (Haas, 2016). This code or program comes in a variety of languages. A computer
                programming language, when compared to natural languages which man uses, simply
                serves to “bridge the gap between something the computer can understand (binary)
                and something that humans can understand, and are capable of crafting programs
                with”. (Foord, n.d.)
                The most common classification of computer languages is that of high-level and
                low level, where the levels are, of course, relative.

                High-level language- code is very similar to English so that almost all computer
                programming these days are done with them.
                Examples: Ada, BASIC, C#, C++, Fortran, HTML, Hugo, Java, Javascript, Logo,
                Modula, Perl, PHP, Python, R, RPG, Simula, Smalltalk, Swift, Visual LISP, ZetaLisp
                
                Advantages:
                a) easier to write, read, debug (fix errors on) and maintain
                b) portable – can be used on many types of computer
                c) produces much shorter code than low-level languages
                
                Disadvantages:
                 a) generally slower than low-level languages
                 b) less efficient in the use of computer resources than low-level languages
                 (Prakash, 2017)

                Examples: assembly languages, such as IBM 360 assembler, PDP-10 assembler,
                Intel x86 assembler, Linux x86-64 assembler (*a computer has its own low-level
